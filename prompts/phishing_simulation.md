# Prompt Template: Phishing Simulation Design

## Goal:
Generate realistic phishing email simulations tailored to user awareness training or SOC analysis.

## Input Variables:
- Threat Level: (e.g., Low, Medium, High)
- Target Audience: (e.g., Entry-level Employee, IT Staff, Executives)
- Simulation Purpose: (e.g., Training, SOC Alert Test, Awareness Campaign)
- Compliance Layer (optional): (e.g., CISA, HIPAA)

## Example Prompt:
You are a cybersecurity trainer. Create a high-threat-level phishing email simulation for an executive.
It should include a suspicious link, a spoofed sender, and urgent tone. Tag it with HIPAA compliance awareness.

## Output Requirements:
- Email Subject Line
- From Field (spoofed)
- Email Body (concise, manipulative language)
- Red Flags Summary
